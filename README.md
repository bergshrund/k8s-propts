| NAME     | PROMPT     | DESCRIPTION                  | EXAMPLE                            |
|----------|------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Pod      | create a pod with name app where image is gcr.io/k8s-k3s/demo:v1.0.0 and port 8000 has name http. Also add two labels app and run with value demo   | Single pod application manifest    | [app.yaml](yaml/app.yaml)|
|CronJon   | create a cronjob with name app-cronjob which will launch every 5 minutes hello container with bash script echoing phrase 'Hello world'| Simple CronJob manifest | [app-cronjob.yaml](yaml/app-cronjob.yaml)|
|Job       | create app-job-rsync job which will run gsutil multi-threaded syncronization of source glow-sportradar backet with /data/input mounted inside google cloud sdk based (tag is 275.0.0-alpine) container with name init. Please, use google cloud persistent disk with name glow-data-disk-200 and ext4 filesystem as a volume with name data-input. Please, never restart this job and consider the job as failed after the first attempt | Google Storage rsync job manifest | [app-job.yaml](yaml/app-job.yaml)|
| Pod with mounted volume | create a pod with name app-volume from image gcr.io/kuar-demo/kuard-amd64:1 where port 8080 has name http and container has name app. Mount host path /var/lib/app as volume with name data on /data. Use liveness and readyness probe on port 8080 with path /healthy and /ready respectively. Define for liveness probe initial delay 5 second, timeout 1 with 3 retry every 10 seconds. Start readiness probe immediately and decrease intervals between retry to 2 second. Consider pod as ready for use after the first reply. | Simple pod with probes and mounted volume | [app-volumeMounts.yaml](yaml/app-volumeMounts.yaml) |
| Multi-container pod | Create multi-container pod with name app-multi-containers where empty dir volume with name html mounted in both containers. But nginx container with name 1st mounted it in the path /usr/share/nginx/html. Second debian based container with name 2nd every second endlessly add current date to /html/index.html | A pod with nginx and an additional container that both share a data volume | [app-multicontainer.yaml](yaml/app-multicontainer.yaml) |
| Pod with resources | create a pod with name app-volume from image gcr.io/kuar-demo/kuard-amd64:1 where port 8080 has name http and container has name app. Mount host path /var/lib/app as volume with name data on /data. Use liveness and readyness probe on port 8080 with path /healthy and /ready respectively. Define for liveness probe initial delay 5 second, timeout 1 with 3 retry every 10 seconds. Start readiness probe immediately and decrease intervals between retry to 2 second. Consider pod as ready for use after the first reply. Set resource request and limit to one hundred millicpu. Anyway, the pod requires 128mi but no more than 256mi | Pod with resource requests and limits | [app-resources.yaml](yaml/app-resources.yaml) |
| Pod with env vars | create pod with name app-secret-env where redis based container with name mycontainer sets two environment variables SECRET_USERNAME and SECRET_PASSWORD. These vars use mysecret1 secret's keys username and password | Pod with creds injected as environment variables | [app-secret-env.yaml](yaml/app-secret-env.yaml) |
